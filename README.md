# DataAugmentation_NLP

Abstract:
Increasing the volume of data enhances model performance, yet annotating large datasets proves costly and time-intensive. Hence, effective data augmentation becomes crucial for enhancing model accuracy.
Text augmentation poses a challenge in NLP due to the intricate nature of language.
The nlpaug library offers various high-performance text augmentation algorithms, capable of substantially improving NLP model performance.

Pre-trained word embedding models like Word2Vec,FastText,GloVe are used,which are beneficial for various NLP tasks, as these models capture semantic information about words and can be used as feature representations in downstream tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.
